Vizion is a ruby gem client library for talking to [[https://docs.vizionapi.com][VIZION API]] built using OpenStruct so you can easily access data in a Ruby-ish way.

[[https://badge.fury.io/rb/vizion.svg]]

** Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
#+begin_src ruby
gem 'vizion'
#+end_src

And then execute:
#+begin_src bash
bundle
#+end_src

Or install it yourself as:
#+begin_src ruby
gem install vizion
#+end_src

** Usage
You'll need to generate an api key: [[https://vizionapi.com/sign-up][https://vizionapi.com/sign-up]]
Initialize client and making request:

#+begin_src ruby
require 'vizion'
client = Vizion::Client.new(api_key: "X-API-Key", timeout: 10)
client.carriers
#+end_src

** Resources

*** Carriers
List of all supported carriers, to view the list [[https://www.notion.so/vizionapi/afa65e3d79fb4a33bc5ce5c331576668?v=a7543be9963441b8aa1ad33962774b85][click here]].

*Actions supported*:
#+begin_src ruby
client.carriers.list
#+end_src

*** References

*Actions supported*:
#+begin_src ruby
client.references.list
client.references.retrieve(id)
client.references.updates(id)
client.references.create({})
client.references.delete(id)
#+end_src

**** Pagination
Use the =page= query parameter to set the current page (default: 1)\\
Use the =per_page= query parameter to set a per page limit (default: 25)

#+begin_src ruby
client.references.list(per_page: 10, page:2)
#+end_src

**** Create Reference with Auto Carrier Identification.
  Add container reference for update tracking without a carrier code. To do this, provide only a =container_id= with in the body request payload. Please note, it will always be faster and more accurate to provide a carrier code when you can.\\
  VIZION API will periodically check for updates and send updates via HTTP POST to the provided =callback_url= parameter.

  *Raw body*
 #+begin_src json
{
    "container_id": "CMAU4049810",
    "callback_url": "https://yourdomain.com/webhook"
}
 #+end_src

 *Ruby way*
#+begin_src ruby
client.references.create(container_id: "CMAU4049810", callback_url: "https://yourdomain.com/webhook")
#+end_src

**** Create Reference with Carrier Code
  Add container reference for update tracking using a carrier code.

  *Raw body*
 #+begin_src json
{
    "container_id": "CAIU4482704",
    "carrier_code": "HDMU",
    "callback_url": "https://yourdomain.com/webhook"
}
 #+end_src

 *Ruby way*
#+begin_src ruby
client.references.create(container_id: "CMAU4049810", carrier_code: "HDMU", callback_url: "https://yourdomain.com/webhook")
#+end_src

If no callback_url parameter is provided, you will need to fetch status updates from the reference_updates action.

**** Milestones event names
Here you can find information on how Vizion standardizes event names.
